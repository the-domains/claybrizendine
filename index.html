</picture><p>“Treat yourself to having your heart lovingly uplifted, melted, touched, and thoroughly warmed by reading, re-reading, and sharing this great book out loud with someone you love, like I did with my wife.”         - Mark Victor Hansen, co-author of the
    Chicken Soup for the Soul series   SHOEBOX LETTERS Shoebox Letters: Daughters to Dads is the first book of the series and is a collection of over 30 letters from daughters to their dads about the role that their dad has played in their life. It is
    a very personal look into the dad / daughter bond. What is a dad to his daughter? Her hero. Her strength. Her role model. And what is a daughter to her dad? His inspiration. His reason to be proud. His reason to smile on a bad day. There is no denying
    that there is a special link between dad and daughter. Shoebox Letters: Daughters to Dads brings that relationship to the forefront through the unique format of letters. Heartfelt storytelling told through the letter, the reader gets a rare, personal
    glimpse into the life of the letter writer and dad to feel the relationship.

</picture><p>Clay is available for keynote speaking and training engagements. From 30 minute talks on the power of communication to all day training on simplification and amplification, Clay will partner with you to deliver the most effective session for your group.
    ​As a current Executive Director of a non-profit, former Marketing Manager at Procter & Gamble, and an owner of his own company, Clay’s experience gives him a unique combination of experiences from which to develop your perfect training. To book Clay
    for an event, please send a note of inquiry to <a href="mailto:info@totalhealthorganization.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@totalhealthorganization.com</a>. TRAINEE TESTIMONIALS We recently held an alumni event where Clay shared
    his “Simplify to Amplify” principles with Kellogg and Northwestern alumni in Cincinnati.  Clay is a motivating and authentic speaker who delivers an on-point health and wellness message tailored to his audience.  His expertise as a personal and corporate
    trainer not only makes him credible to deliver this message, but also inspires those who hear it to act.  As the Club Chair, I found Clay to be a joy to work with, highly invested in a positive result and logistically flawless.  Among alumni, his
    presentation received extremely positive feedback.  Net, his message is strong and I would enjoy working with him again. I appreciated Clay’s genuine and personal approach to his presentation style. It was obvious that Clay was passionate about the
    material and his delivery was honest and compassionate. It is clear that Clay is following and has benefited from the lessons that he shared, and it makes me more likely to follow-up myself. His sharing of personal situations brought the training
    to life. Early on in the training, Clay shared a personal struggle he and his family had been through. Him doing this endeared me to him and to the training. It made me listen. Instead of just coming off as a super fit guy who’s got his whole life
    in order, he came off as a real person. Being a single mom, having someone I could identify with made this training that much more fulfilling to me.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="31"><div class="Attribution op-70 font-title " data-reactid="32"><h5 data-reactid="33"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="34"><a href="http://claybrizendine.me">claybrizendine.me</a></span></h5></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalSmallColumn-6bf19084-bd31-4bd9-88ed-9938987d5f2f" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-small color-title  color-bg text-align-center group-graphical-shape-circle  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="35"><div class="Component ms-fx-r p-1 ms-p-h-3 ls-p-h-13vw  a-i-start " data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="37"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="38"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="39"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0e677f4341060a63512e837845f8884d/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F2461e8707fa79e697b18e135df97905091497954.jpg&amp;width=288" style="object-position:10.590277777777777% 50.641025641025635%;" data-reactid="40"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0e677f4341060a63512e837845f8884d/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F2461e8707fa79e697b18e135df97905091497954.jpg&amp;width=288" style="object-position:10.590277777777777% 50.641025641025635%;" data-reactid="41"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0e677f4341060a63512e837845f8884d/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F2461e8707fa79e697b18e135df97905091497954.jpg&amp;width=288" style="object-position:10.590277777777777% 50.641025641025635%;" data-reactid="42"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0e677f4341060a63512e837845f8884d/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F2461e8707fa79e697b18e135df97905091497954.jpg&amp;width=288" style="object-position:10.590277777777777% 50.641025641025635%;" data-reactid="43"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="288" data-height="78" data-ratio="3.6923076923076925" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0e677f4341060a63512e837845f8884d/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F2461e8707fa79e697b18e135df97905091497954.jpg&amp;width=288" style="object-position:10.590277777777777% 50.641025641025635%;" data-reactid="44"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px fx-2 t-a-l" data-reactid="45"><!-- react-empty: 46 --><div class="Attribution op-70 font-title " data-reactid="47"><h5 data-reactid="48"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="49"><a href="http://claybrizendine.me">claybrizendine.me</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 50 --><!-- react-empty: 51 --><!-- react-empty: 52 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="53"><p>Understand your true priorities, passionately engage with them, and feel better than you ever have.
