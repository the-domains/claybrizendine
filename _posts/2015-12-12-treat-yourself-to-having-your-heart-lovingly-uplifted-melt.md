"Treat yourself to having your heart lovingly uplifted, melted, touched, and thoroughly warmed by reading, re-reading, and sharing this great book out loud with someone you love, like I did with my wife."         - Mark Victor Hansen, co-author of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series   SHOEBOX LETTERS Shoebox Letters: Daughters to Dads is the first book of the series and is a collection of over 30 letters from daughters to their dads about the role that their dad has played in their life. It is a very personal look into the dad / daughter bond. What is a dad to his daughter? Her hero. Her strength. Her role model. And what is a daughter to her dad? His inspiration. His reason to be proud. His reason to smile on a bad day. There is no denying that there is a special link between dad and daughter. Shoebox Letters: Daughters to Dads brings that relationship to the forefront through the unique format of letters. Heartfelt storytelling told through the letter, the reader gets a rare, personal glimpse into the life of the letter writer and dad to feel the relationship.
